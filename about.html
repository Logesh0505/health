			<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
			<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our health to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Strength training</dt>
				<dd>Good weight training routines for women over 50 include lifting weights, as well as exercises that involve the use of resistance, such as Pilates or working out with resistance bands. <span class="viewex" onclick="Strengthtraining()"> View Example.</span></dd>
				
				<dt>Aerobic/cardiovascular</dt>
				<dd>Aerobic or cardiovascular exercises are sometimes called endurance exercises, since you are supposed to maintain them for at least 10 minutes. During aerobic exercise, your heart rate and breathing should increase, but you should still be able to carry on a conversation with a workout buddy. Walking, jogging and swimming are all examples of aerobic exercise. <span class="viewex" onclick="Aerobiccardiovascular()"> View Example.</span> </dd>
				
				<dt>Stretching</dt>
				<dd>Stretching exercises help improve or maintain flexibility, reducing the risk of injury to the muscles or joints. Yoga is a popular type of stretching exercise. <span class="viewex" onclick="Stretching()"> View Example.</span></dd>
